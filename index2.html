Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock.
Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary
 human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species
 created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities
. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago.
 After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years
 ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years
 ago. Pigs, sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000
 years ago.</p>
 <p>Plants were independently cultivated in at least
 11 regions of the world. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale
 monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural
 output, though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence
 agriculture into the twenty-first.Agriculture, specifically farming, 
remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk
 of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin
 diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged
 sun exposure. On industrialized farms, injuries frequently involve the use
<p>Agriculture, for decades, had been associated with the production of basic food crops. Agriculture and farming were synonymous so long as farming was not commercialized. But as the process of economic development accelerated, many more other occupations allied to farming came to be recognized as a part of agriculture.

At present, agriculture besides farming includes forestry, fruit cultivation, dairy, poultry, mushroom, bee keeping, arbitrary, etc. Today, marketing, processing, distribution of agricultural products etc. are all accepted as a part of modern agriculture.
<p>Thus, agriculture may be defined as the production, processing, marketing and distribution of crops and livestock products. According to Webster’s Dictionary, “agriculture is the art or science of production of crops and livestock on farm.”
Agriculture plays a crucial role in the life of an economy. It is the backbone of our economic system. Agriculture not only provides food and raw material but also employment opportunities to a very large proportion of population. The following facts clearly highlight the importance of agriculture in this country.
In India the main occupation of our working population is agriculture. About 70 per cent of our population is directly engaged in agriculture. In advanced countries, this ratio is very small being 5 per cent in U.K., 4 per cent in USA., 16 per cent in Australia, 14 per cent in France, 21 per cent in Japan and 32 per cent in USSR.
